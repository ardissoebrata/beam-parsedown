# Icon

You can easily display fontawesome icons. To add an icon, simply write `icon:` followed with the class icon that you want to display in square brackets.

[icon: fa fa-home]

[icon: fa fa-ambulance]

[icon: fa fa-archway]

The icon size is displayed according to the context of the icon's position. The size of the icon in the heading will be relatively larger than the size of the paragraph icon.

[icon: fa fa-home]

# [icon: fa fa-home] Home

## [icon: fa fa-home] Home 2 {.main .shine #the-site lang=fr}
