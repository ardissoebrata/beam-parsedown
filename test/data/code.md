# Code

To denote a word or phrase as code, enclose it in tick marks (\`).

At the command prompt, type `nano`.

## Escaping Tick Marks

If the word or phrase you want to denote as code includes one or more tick marks, you can escape it by enclosing the word or phrase in double tick marks (\`\`).

``Use `code` in your Markdown file.``

## Code Blocks

To create code blocks, enclose the block in triple tick marks(\`\`\`).

```
<html>
	<head>
	</head>
</html>
```

## Syntax Highlighting

Many Markdown processors support syntax highlighting for fenced code blocks. To add syntax highlighting, specify a language next to the tick marks before the fenced code block.

```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "age": 25
}
```
